## AWS CloudFormation for optimizing AWS Config for AWS Security Hub

This repo contains the CloudFormation template to set up AWS Config to record only whatâ€™s needed for Security Hub as detailed in the AWS Security Blog Post: Optimize AWS Config for AWS Security Hub. Check out the blog for more information on how to use this CloudFormation template.

### Requirements

This CloudFormation template only works if AWS Config is not currently enabled in the account/region that you want to run it in. For more information on managing the AWS Config recorder check out the [AWS Config User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/stop-start-recorder.html).

### Getting Started

Download the CloudFormation template (`AWS-Config-optimized-for-AWS-Security-Hub.yaml`) and deploy it from the console. You can also use AWS CloudFormation StackSets to deploy, update, or delete the template across multiple accounts and Regions with a single operation. 

### Template Parameters

- DeliveryChannelName
    - The name of the delivery channel.
- Frequency
    - The frequency with which AWS Config delivers configuration snapshots.
- TopicArn
    - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that AWS Config delivers notifications to. Note: Leaving `<New Topic>` as the TopicArn will result in the generation of a new topic.
- NotificationEmail
    - Email address for AWS Config notifications (for new topics).
